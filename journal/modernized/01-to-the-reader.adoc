== To the Reader

In the preparation of the following pages for publication,
there has been little more required, than to select and arrange the matter,
from the copious and long-kept diary of my late beloved brother.
In them will be found depicted, in simplicity and self-abasement,
the dealings of the Lord with one, whose main desire from early life,
next to the salvation of his soul,
was to be qualified for the service of his Divine Master,
and to be rightly employed in his Church.

As the reader traces his growth in Grace,
he can form his own judgment of the stature he attained in Christ Jesus his Lord.
It will be seen, that in common with other faithful servants of a crucified Master,
he was often baptized into suffering and death;
that he might be prepared to visit the oppressed Seed, to partake, in his measure,
of the afflictions to be filled up for the body`'s sake, which is the Church,
and to experience in himself the work of sanctification,
and the renewings of that life which is hid with Christ in God.

He shows that he knew what it was,
to be often clothed with a humbling sense of his frailty and his inability, as a man,
for any good word or work; that he felt the necessity of keeping constantly on the watch,
lest he should be betrayed into trusting in anything belonging to himself,
and to seek for that Divine anointing,
which alone could fit him for the position he occupied in the Church,
and to engage in the work assigned him.

But while a correct estimate of his religious character
may be drawn from the record made by his own pen,
it may not be inappropriate to add a few words,
to enable the reader to form some correct appreciation of his natural endowments,
and his bearing in the domestic and social circles in which he moved.

He possessed good mental abilities, and though his scholastic education was not equal,
in some respects, to that now provided for the children of Friends,
yet his quick perception, his habits of accurate observation and correct reasoning,
together with a fondness for instructive reading,
enabled him to store his mind with a fund of sound knowledge,
that rendered his conversation interesting and profitable.
With warm, natural affection for his family and other connections,
he attached them more strongly to himself by
kindness and manifest interest in their welfare,
than by the ties of consanguinity.
Though he speaks of being often cast down and distressed,
on account of the state of the professing Church,
yet such was his care to wash and anoint, so as not to appear unto men to fast,
that there were few who more generally maintained a chastened cheerfulness,
or whose deportment was more free from repulsive reserve.
His manner was genial, and marked by simplicity and sincerity; and social interaction,
however diversified, soon revealed, that the subjects which lay nearest to his heart,
were the work of salvation, and the spread of the Redeemer`'s kingdom.

His ministry was fervent, forcible and fluent;
manifesting concern to reach the Witness for Truth in the hearts of his hearers,
rather than to convince by argument, or please by eloquence;
and while his Christian love embraced those of every denomination,
who loved the Lord Jesus in sincerity,
it flowed preeminently to his fellow members in the Society of Friends,
whose religious growth and stability were objects of his deepest solicitude;
to promote which, he was ever ready to spend and be spent.
