1852, Twelfth month.
I have mourned over the weaknesses observable in many,
who seem to be almost insensibly drawn aside by the influence of rich men,
the love of grandeur, and the pride and self-consequence which wealth gives.
There is a powerful temptation to fall in with the stream of fashionable life,
and to coincide with the opinions of rich, nominal Quakers; to mingle with them,
and to give children an education conformable to the standard which they erect;
however different from the course that true, consistent Friends,
believe the Holy Spirit leads into.
This makes an unfavorable distinction between
the children of those who despise the cross,
and the children of conscientious members, who feel bound to regard its restrictions.
But I have seen and felt,
that it is far better to keep to the requisitions of Grace in all things;
bearing the cross faithfully,
and disregarding the shame which the world attaches to a life of self-denial,
both for our own everlasting good, and for the sake of our children.

The influx of wealth into our country is producing its natural
effects upon those who have the power of accumulating it.
Where some are suddenly made rich,
others are tempted to put forth their hands to get gain,
that they also may be made rich and honorable among men, like their contemporaries.
As wealth is acquired, large showy houses are sometimes provided,
to suit the standing of the rich man, with sumptuous,
fashionable furniture to correspond.
Families, even with comparatively plain garb,
finding themselves thus surrounded with grandeur,
and the means to indulge their inclinations,
may become inflated with the idea that they are
superior to those of the middle or poorer rank;
and a disposition to look upon them with a supercilious air, may arise in the mind;
and the daily application to the Lord for his preserving power, be much forgotten.
The children of such persons become exalted above the simplicity of the cross,
and are in danger of looking with a degree of contempt, on their young friends,
whose parents have not the means, or are not easy, to go into a fashionable,
luxurious mode of living.
They are in danger of growing up with,
or imbibing an enmity to the testimonies and discipline of our Society,
and of becoming lost to it.
Our strength is thereby wasted, and we fail to exert that influence in the world,
for which we were designed.
Instead of carrying on the work of reformation, by lives of purity and self-denial,
many are in great danger of going back into the customs of the world,
out of which Friends were originally gathered.
Where those who take an active part in the affairs of the Society have grown rich,
and are living in a spirit of self-importance,
and manage its concerns in their own wisdom, it has a leavening effect upon others;
the life and gathering power of religion will be excluded,
and the right authority of meetings will be lost.

5th. Our evening meeting was large.
I felt drawn to advert to the lowly,
humble manner in which our Savior came into the world; his birthplace a stable,
and being laid in a manger, though He was the Son of the Highest,
and had all power in heaven and in earth.
It was declared by the angel of the Lord,
when he informed the shepherds that a Savior was born unto them in the city of David;
"`And this shall be a sign unto you,
you shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.`"
It appeared to be my place to warn those who were living in grandeur and pride,
of their danger in giving way to this exalted spirit,
and of the prejudicial effects it must have upon themselves, and their children,
by shutting out of the heart the precious influence of the Spirit of the Redeemer.
There was a deep, solemn stillness over the meeting, and we came away,
thankful for the extension of Divine help and favor.

26th. As we walked to meeting this afternoon, observing the plain dresses of Friends,
who mingled with others,
I recollected that more than two hundred years have
elapsed since George Fox commenced his ministry;
opening to the people the spiritual nature of the gospel dispensation; what it requires,
and what a change it effects in those who yield
to the renovating power of the Holy Spirit;
cleansing the heart and regulating their whole deportment.
Here is still a people, distinguished by their doctrines, their simple garb,
their scriptural language, and their unfashionable manners;
all which is an evidence of the continued care,
power and goodness of the Lord towards us; and which ought to unite us in gratitude,
increasing fervor, and faithfulness to our God.
In proportion to the greatness of the testimonies committed to us,
and the clear discovery of the doctrines and precepts of the gospel,
is our responsibility; and did we keep steadfastly to our Divine Guide,
in living up to his heavenly nature and dictates, we should be like an army with banners;
that would be enabled to shake the kingdom of antichrist,
and turn the people effectually to Christ, in his spiritual appearance in their hearts;
that they might know Him to be their hope of glory.
We had a very precious meeting this morning.
In the evening, we had also a solid meeting;
in which the gospel was preached in the opening and authority of the Holy Spirit.

29th. The visiting of the families belonging thereto,
having received the consideration of our last Monthly Meeting,
and a committee then appointed by men Friends, it was now introduced to women Friends,
who united with it, and appointed a committee to join us in the service.

1853, First month 5th. The committee divided into two parts,
allotting a portion of the members to each, which have been engaged in the work.
Divine help was graciously extended, in opening the different states,
and giving the word, to my admiration, for the various conditions.
Poverty and emptiness were my portion at times,
but I hope some will be stirred up to more faithfulness,
and others induced to put away the household idols with which they are surrounded.

17th. After having had quite mild weather most of the winter, the mercury fell,
through yesterday, to fourteen degrees,
making a very sensible contrast with the temperature we have had.
It will cause suffering to many of the improvident ones,
who observe no economy with what they get, nor exert themselves as they ought,
when employment is to be had.
Their needs call into action the sympathies of many,
whose hearts might otherwise be engrossed with the love of their possessions;
and for lack of objects of charity, or calls for aid,
might scarcely ever experience these tender feelings,
and the disposition to hand relief to a suffering fellow being.
"`Blessed is he that considers the poor, the Lord will deliver him in time of trouble.`"

Feelings of destitution of Divine good have been my portion;
and fears have attended of not being sufficiently concerned to draw near to the Lord,
in prayer for heavenly bread, and his sustaining power.
Yesterday I was constrained to warn my brethren and sisters,
of the danger of having the mind too much engrossed even with lawful things,
so as to deter us from waiting upon the Lord daily for the renewal of spiritual strength;
and producing neglect of our duty to watch and pray continually.

29th. Last fourth-day was held our Monthly Meeting;
in which all the Queries were answered,
and report made of the completion of the family visit to our members.
I thought a religious weight covered us; and some lively remarks were made,
to guard the members against submitting to temptation to depart from our testimonies;
particularly relating to the plural language to a single person,
and against a sumptuous and fashionable mode of living,
which leads to an improper education of children;
by which they are taken out of the Society.

Having felt my mind drawn in tender sympathy to some of
the small meetings in Chester and Delaware Counties,
Pennsylvania, I laid the concern before the Monthly Meeting, and was liberated,
by a general expression of unity, to visit the meetings of Cain, the Western,
and Concord Quarterly Meetings, as way may open for it.
Our only hope and trust are in the tender compassion of an omniscient Shepherd,
who sees the hearts of all, and can administer comfort, wisdom and strength to support,
and safely guide his poor dependent children under all their trials,
to the accomplishment of his will.

In the afternoon.
I crossed the river, in order to visit our ancient friend Hinchman Haines,
if he was in a situation to be seen; he having been ill for about ten days;
and also to attend the meeting at Evesham, where he belonged.
When I got to his son`'s house, next morning,
I found he had departed the preceding evening.
He was a pillar in the church of Christ; a living, baptizing minister;
and a firm and consistent supporter of the doctrines and
testimonies of the gospel held by our religious Society;
and in the spreading of which, he travelled much in the ministry.
Being possessed of a good judgment, and a cheerful disposition, and having,
from an early period of his life, been disciplined in the school of Christ,
his conversation was interesting and instructive
to the sincere lovers and seekers of the Truth.
Though he was firm in his attachment to the truth,
and in maintaining what he believed was right,
yet when his friends did not see eye to eye with him,
in things not decided on by the body, he treated them in a sweet, christian spirit,
and did not allow himself to say anything to lessen their reputation,
or standing in the church.
He was in the eighty-sixth year of his age,
and his removal will be much felt by many who have partaken of his ministry,
and among whom he was a father in Christ, and an example of christian gravity,
simplicity and self-denial.

30th. I attended the meeting for worship, of which H. Haines had long been a member,
and a sorrowful feeling spread over us.
I felt unfit to be employed in any service;
yet I thought under the impressions that covered my mind,
it would be unsafe to refrain from testifying to the power and goodness of the Lord,
in breaking us off from the wild olive tree; and,
through the baptisms of the Holy Ghost and fire,
preparing us for membership in the church of Christ,
and to receive gifts to be occupied in the
station which He allots for every obedient one.
It was this made our fathers living members of Christ,
and qualified them to advocate and uphold his cause.
And the same blessed power, I believed,
would continue to raise up living witnesses to the truth;
and also those who would publish the glad tidings of salvation,
and what the Lord had done for their souls.

Second month 8th. This morning my wife and myself rode to our brother-in-law`'s,
J+++.+++ Rhoads, whom we found preparing to set out with me on the visit in Chester County.
The fellowship subsisting between us is very grateful and strengthening.

In the afternoon, he and I rode to E. M.`'s, where we found a comfortable stopping-place,
and in the evening, several Friends came in, whose company was cheering.

9th. Attended their usual mid-week meeting at Whiteland;
at which we had the company of a dear young minister,
visiting Friends`' families of this place.
I felt drawn in spirit to some exercised ones,
to whom the language of the Most High was addressed,
"`Fear you not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, I am your God;`"
"`I will never leave you nor forsake you;`"
also that of our Savior to his disciples,
"`Lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the world;`"
and the way was opened to comfort and strengthen the lowly,
tribulated ones, whose faith was deeply proven.
Afterwards to show forth to a different class,
the great importance of obeying the discoveries of the Holy Spirit,
by which the work of salvation is begun and perfected in man,
as he yields to and follows it.
Our beloved friend knelt in thanksgiving, for the help extended to the poor in spirit,
and for the renewed call and offer of mercy to the rebellious;
also praying that the dear children might be gathered.
It proved the truth of the saying,
"`He that waters shall be watered also himself;`" affording me comfort from a young,
devoted child of the Lord, particularly as I was now just setting out on a journey.

We dined with our friends J. M. and sisters, who were truly kind in entertaining us;
and in the afternoon, rode to M. E.`'s, who received us with much affection.
The evening was occupied in cheerful conversation,
mostly touching subjects of a serious nature.

10th. We were at Uwchlan Monthly Meeting;
in which the dear Master furnished fresh authority and ability to labor in his cause;
many appearing to be immersed in the love and pursuit of the things of the world,
whereby their strength is much laid waste,
and the life and power of religion at a low ebb.
That love which seeks the everlasting welfare of all clothed my mind;
in which I was enabled to bring some things home to their feelings with much plainness,
and which appeared to be well received.
But oh, how are the minds of many going into the earth,
and losing the little zeal they may once have felt;
and their children taking wings into the air, soaring above the witness for God,
and setting at nought the testimonies which our faithful predecessors nobly bore.

We dined near the meetinghouse; and a young man having agreed to accompany us,
we set out for Robeson, the road lying over a hilly country,
and rough at this season of the year.
The Monthly Meeting held so late, we could not go through before night,
and were obliged to put up at a tavern, in the beautiful Conestoga valley,
which is esteemed as good land, and well-cultivated, as most in that part of the country.

11th. We set off pretty early, and getting directions, found our way to J. S.`'s,
who received us kindly.
As they knew nothing of our coming,
though they said they had looked for some Friends the preceding evening,
and the time was so short,
but little notice could be spread of our intention to be at the meeting;
yet from what was said, I supposed it would have been still less,
than the little company we met there.
They seemed to be in a low state, as regards the knowledge of a right exercise of mind,
in the performance of spiritual worship;
having fallen into great indifference respecting the attendance of their meetings.
The feeling was very affecting; but after sitting in much poverty,
I was moved to bring to view, the deadening influence of a worldly spirit,
and to labor to stir them up to consider seriously their situation,
and to come under the refining power of Christ,
that they might be qualified to support his cause.
We dined with a member, who looked nothing like a Friend;
and had an opportunity with him and his family;
in which were plainly laid before them the responsibility of parents,
and the influence of their example.

12th. Took our departure, this morning, over the hills for Downingtown.
On approaching the Conestoga valley,
it lay before us as a beautiful expanse of well-fenced and cultivated fields,
with substantial farm-houses;
where the hand of industry has done much to please and to accommodate man.
All this is proper in its place,
but falls short of securing true happiness to the owners, without a life of godliness,
and devotion to the will and the glory of the great Creator.
About two o`'clock, we reached our stopping-place, where we remained until next afternoon.

13th. Being first day, a pretty large company of men convened at the meeting,
the women not so many.
To me it was rather a laborious time, among a class who seemed much in a worldly spirit;
but Divine help was extended, and the importance of regeneration,
and a life of godliness, was enforced.
Towards the close, I was enabled to prostrate myself, in humble supplication,
for the negligent and unfaithful; for the young people and the few burden-bearers;
that the Lord would work in us all by his love and mighty power,
to the reduction of everything into obedience to Himself,
and preserve us every moment from the power of temptation;
that we may fill up the measure of allotted suffering and duty, to the glory of his Name,
and our salvation in the end.
It was a tendering close to some, and I came away cleared and peaceful.
Returned to our lodgings, dined, and soon after left for West-town;
which we reached after a muddy ride, the roads being much softened by the melted snow.

14th. Attended the Quarterly Meeting of Ministers and Elders, at Concord;
in which a little ability was granted, to encourage those present,
to engage with renewed zeal and diligence, in the Lord`'s cause and work.
At our friend N. Sharpless, we had the company of dear friends,
with whom I passed the evening with satisfaction.

15th. Rose with desires for preservation in lowliness of mind,
that I might abide with the suffering Seed, and be kept under Divine guidance;
so as to do nothing but what was of the Holy Spirit`'s begetting and putting forth.
Early in the meeting, a woman Friend, E. S., appeared in prayer; and sometime after,
I was led to declare as my belief, there is still preserved among us,
those who are standing for the Truth, and who are clothed with fear on their own account;
to whom the language of the Savior is applicable,
"`Fear not, little flock, it is your Father`'s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.`"
Towards these, with whom I was united in the love and fellowship of the gospel,
the stream of encouragement and consolation flowed freely.
Then in the tender love of God, I was drawn to address the dear young people,
and to invite them to come to the Savior and follow Him,
and He would prepare them for his work in the church.
The power of the adorable Head rose into dominion, and it was a humbling,
contriting season; I thought more so than I have often known;
for which I was humbled and thankful to the Lord`'s great Name.

In the afternoon, we rode to Birmingham, and put up with a Friend,
near the old meetinghouse; near which many of the slain at the battle of Brandywine,
during the revolutionary war, were interred.
A christian must feel horror at the thought of immortal
beings being rushed into the presence of Almighty God,
in the fury of battle,
and with every nerve strained to murder and beat down their
fellow candidates for immortality and eternal blessedness.
How can it be, that any one who believes in the coming and sufferings of the Son of God,
to save lost man; who died that we might live to Him,
can contend that war and bloodshed are lawful, and still less engage in them.
To love our enemies, which is his command,
is totally incompatible with using every effort to destroy them.
"`A new commandment I give unto you, that you love one another; as I have loved you,
that you also love one another.`"

16th. A storm blew up in the night, with heavy rain,
which gave the morning a dreary appearance,
and led us to expect our appointed meeting would be small;
but a greater number came than I had looked for.
Salvation by the coming of Christ, in the flesh and by his Holy Spirit, transforming man,
was preached,
and the fearful consequences of denying his
divinity and propitiatory offering for our sins,
were held up to view.
The burden-bearers, and the dear young people,
were encouraged to come to the compassionate Shepherd of the sheep,
and apply to Him for wisdom and strength to do his will.

In the afternoon, we went to our aged friend Moses Bailey`'s, and lodged.
He was from home, but his family treated us with much kindness, and in the morning,
his son piloted us over to Cain meetinghouse.
Attended the Select Quarterly Meeting, composed of seven men and two women Friends.
It appeared to be in a low condition,
and I was drawn to hold up the importance of faithful dedication to the cause of Christ,
as examples of the flock; to warn them as watchmen on the walls,
which the great Head has placed around us,
of the snares with which the enemy seeks to lay us waste.
Also of the importance of deep, inward abiding with Christ, that wherever we go,
the savor of Divine life may go with us, and have an influence upon others.
They were also reminded of the tendency of our young
people to go into the fashions of a corrupt world,
and to become rulers over their parents,
instead of their parents governing and restraining them in these things.
These remarks flowed like a gentle stream,
accompanied with an affectionate desire for their strength and encouragement.

Dined at J. E.`'s, where we had a little opportunity to hold up to some present,
that the harvest was plenteous, and the laborers few,
and to invite them to increased dedication.
Went to C. D.`'s and lodged, where we received very kind attention.

18th. The weather was now fine, and the roads on the hills pretty good,
which is desirable at the convening of this Quarterly Meeting.
Nearly all the old members and standard-bearers
of this meeting have been removed by death.
There are young and middle-aged persons, who appear to be consistent Friends,
and under a right exercise, yet there was a feeling of weakness,
and of degeneracy among many.
I was engaged to show the necessity of being brought to feel our own nothingness,
and to submit to those dispensations,
by which we are brought into the state of a little child;
so as to know Christ`'s kingdom and reign to be set up in the heart,
and to receive from Him gifts to occupy to his praise.
When we are brought into the household of faith, and into a humbling view of ourselves,
it is needful to guard against the temptation to cast away our shield,
and be thereby disabled from performing our duties in the church.
By looking improperly at the many discouragements of this day of great trial,
we may suffer ourselves to be cast down, as if there was no hope.
I believed the Lord was at work in the hearts of the young people;
and it is our place to keep the faith that He will arise for our help and deliverance;
and under his direction, that we be found inviting and drawing them to Christ,
and encouraging them to be faithful to all his requirings.
Rode to W. N. S.`'s about two miles, and lodged; having Moses Bailey for our guide.

19th. The ride this morning was over a rough road to West Cain, and the weather cold,
with a northeast wind.
The appointed meeting here was larger than was anticipated, some Presbyterians,
separatists and others, with a few Friends; to whom the gospel was preached,
of the universal love of God to man, in sending his well-beloved Son to save the world,
by the atonement made by Him, and by giving to all a measure of grace;
showing that all may be saved if they obey its teachings.
This was declared in the fresh openings and authority of the Holy Spirit.
I was also bowed in humble prayer for the extending of heavenly good to all,
that living witnesses might be raised up in that place,
to the power and excellency of the religion of the Lord Jesus.
It appeared to me to be a day of favor and Divine
condescension to us poor unworthy creatures;
for surely it was the Lord`'s work to open matter for the conditions of the people.

We dined about half a mile from the meetinghouse; and before leaving,
Moses Bailey and I went to see an aged Friend.
She appeared to be an afflicted woman, and yet showed the dignity and composure,
with which the Lord clothes those who have loved and served Him to old age,
in a life of devotion to his cause and the welfare of the church.
There was a word of consolation sprang in my heart for her,
and we parted under feelings of respect and sympathy for an aged servant of Christ,
now in her eighty-seventh year.

We had a very rough ride over the hills to Moses Baily`'s,
the roads continuing to be hard frozen;
but it was pleasant to return to the peaceful residence of this honest-hearted elder,
and his kind wife.

20th. First-day.
Attended Bradford Meeting, which was large, composed of Friends and others.
It was not so comforting a time as at some places;
yet there was ability afforded to open many things
pertaining to the condition of man in transgression,
the means to bring him out of it,
and the necessity of continued watchfulness after we are brought out;
for Satan is at work, even to draw down those,
who may be as stars in the firmament of God`'s power.
The necessity of rightly governing the children, restraining them from wrong things,
and setting them a proper example, was laid before them.
As we come under this religious exercise, we shall be favored, at seasons,
to hold communion with our heavenly Father, and thus know our strength renewed.
He said, respecting his servant,
"`Shall I hide from Abraham that thing that I do?
For I know him, that he will command his household and his children after him;`"
hereby confirming the importance of rightly governing our beloved children;
which can be done only as we are living under the Divine government ourselves,
feeling the great importance of this subjection to, and communion with the Lord,
and receiving wisdom and ability from Him to order our own households.

Returned to Moses Baily`'s, and dined with a company of Friends who stopped there.
In the afternoon, we rode ten or eleven miles to East Sadsbury, and lodged.
On the 22nd, we attended an appointed meeting here; and that afternoon,
after dining with a woman Friend,
and having a religious opportunity with her and children, we rode up to Bart.
Next day had an appointed meeting there, with a company of tender-spirited Friends,
to our and their satisfaction.
Then rode to the house of a Friend belonging to Sadsbury Meeting, where we lodged;
and on the 23rd, attended their regular meeting, which was small and laborious.

There was a measure of holy help vouchsafed to perform
what appeared to be required in these meetings.
I thought there were sincerely concerned Friends in all of them,
and some of the younger and middle-aged, appear to be under religious exercise;
among whom I hoped there would be some raised up,
whom the Lord would qualify to support the doctrines and testimonies of the gospel,
under the guidance of his Spirit.
Surely were we faithful, abounding in the work of the Lord,
the same good Hand that gathered our forefathers, from the "`lo heres,
and lo theres,`" would still be with us,
and exalt his name and his goodness in the midst of us.

24th. Were at the Western Quarterly Meeting of Ministers and Elders, which is very small.
Here we met my brother Joseph Evans and wife, and sister Hannah Rhoads,
which was cheering.
All of us went to J. P.`'s, a pleasant resting place, and remained until the next day;
which afforded an opportunity to enquire after our home connections and friends,
and to partake in the satisfaction of free and
pleasant converse with our kind entertainers.

25th. Attended the Quarterly Meeting for business.
I was brought low in sitting down in the meeting,
feeling unworthy to be employed in the Lord`'s work; but after a time of inward reduction,
and looking to the alone Helper of his people,
the quickening power of his Spirit sprung up a little in my mind, and under its guidance,
I was led to open the simplicity and certainty of the gospel dispensation;
adapted to all capacities, and brought home to every heart;
that man with all his wisdom and research, cannot find out any other way,
by which the soul can be saved;
nor is he able by any power that he possesses as a creature,
even to give himself a sight of his lost condition.

He only, who is the way, the truth and the life, can show him where and what he is,
and what He requires him to become; giving him power to forsake sin;
and He alone can set up his kingdom in his heart.
When the rich man, in a state of torment,
besought Abraham to send one to warn his brethren, lest they should come into that place,
Abraham answered, they have Moses and the prophets, let them hear them;
but still urging his request, he was told, "`If they hear not Moses and the prophets,
neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.`"
When Christ came, He said, "`I am the door.
He that enters not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbs up some other way,
the same is a thief and a robber.`"
And the apostle said,
"`Though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you,
than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.`"
All these show there is no way of salvation but that
which is appointed by our great and gracious Creator;
and unless man complies with the terms,
there is no ground on which to rest any hope of being saved in the end.
I thought the humbling power of Christ spread over the meeting,
and brought with it a feeling of solemnity and contrition of spirit.
My sister Hannah Rhoads, knelt in supplication and thanksgiving,
which humbled the hearts of many.
After the meeting we dined, went to Fallowfield and lodged.

26th. We had a meeting at this place, the number of Friends being small;
and some of them giving little evidence in their appearance,
of feeling regard for the simplicity and self-denial of the cross and gospel of Christ;
being gone out into the spirit and fashions of the world;
with whom I was engaged to labor,
in order to draw them to yield to the Holy Spirit in their own hearts.
I was also led to supplicate our merciful Heavenly Father,
on behalf of his afflicted children,
and for the gathering of those who have wandered from the right way,
and that He would extend preservation to all.

27th. Went to West Grove Meeting,
where formerly belonged our ancient and honorable friends William and Hannah Jackson;
whose memory is precious,
and their solid christian example worthy to be followed more faithfully than it has been,
by many in that meeting.
Notice having been given two days before, and being first-day, the company was large,
many not being members.
The service was laborious, but I felt clear and peaceful at the close.
Dined, and then rode to Joshua Sharpless`', at London Britain.

28th. Had an appointed meeting at London Britain, composed of Friends and others;
in which I was drawn forth for the encouragement of the devoted few in this place,
that they might increase in faithfulness to the Lord and his cause.
Towards the close of what I had to deliver,
I was led to warn against the spirit that was rejecting the gospel of Christ,
and turning the back upon the Holy Scriptures;
that the end of those who submitted to it would be awful,
did they persist until the day of mercy was overpast.
I was a stranger to such, if there were any in the meeting;
but afterwards was told there was one at least of that character present.

Third month 1st. The weather was cloudy and foggy most of yesterday;
this morning it rained, and appeared very dreary to turn out in,
but we rode about four miles to Hockesson.
But few Friends belong here;
some of them were absent from indisposition and other causes,
yet the company was larger than we had reason to expect.
It was an exercising time to me, so few seeming to be acquainted with spiritual worship,
and that travail of soul which is necessary for our life in the Truth.
The workings of an evil disposition to draw persons away from the religion of the gospel,
prevails in some, which brings darkness into meetings.

2nd. Attended their usual week-day meeting, at New Garden;
in which the gospel of Christ was declared,
and Friends encouraged to increased faithfulness in the support of our testimonies.

3rd. Went to Kennet Meeting;
in which the necessity of placing our confidence and trust in the Shepherd of Israel,
and not depending upon man, was held forth among them;
in accordance with the apostle`'s testimony,
that his speech and his preaching were "`Not with enticing words of man`'s wisdom,
but in the demonstration of the Spirit and of power;
that their faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.`"

The visit to most of the meetings of this
Quarter has been attended with the apprehension,
that the spirit of infidelity in some form,
is striving to lay waste the doctrines of the christian religion,
and to draw some of our members into its dreadful vortex.
Unless Friends keep watchful over themselves and their children,
prohibiting the use of those pernicious publications
that set forth and contend for these delusions;
and also abstaining from associating with unbelievers,
the minds of their young people may be poisoned,
and the Society in these parts be scattered.

4th. After dining, we rode to Willistown,
where we had notice spread for a meeting to be held on the 4th; which we attended,
to some comfort; and the next day, the 5th, had a meeting at Goshen;
both of which were satisfactory.
The spirits of the humble, exercised travailers for Zion`'s prosperity,
were a little revived, and encouraged to trust in the Lord,
and to labor for the welfare of the flock, over whom they are overseers.
We lodged the preceding night, with our friends Pennock and Sarah Passmore,
with whom and others here,
the cementing influence of gospel fellowship was felt to unite us together.

After dining with J. and P. K., we rode to West Chester,
and put up at the residence of our beloved mother in the Truth, Hannah Gibbons;
who received us with much kindness,
and under whose roof and maternal care we felt it a favor to be lodged.

6th. Being first-day, we had a pretty full meeting of Friends and others;
and the Lord condescended to furnish ability to call
upon all who had not submitted to his convicting power,
and to show to them that He had not dealt with us according to our deserts;
but in merciful and unmerited long suffering and forbearance,
was still following after the rebellious,
and striving to draw them into the obedience of the cross of Christ.
These were pleaded with, in the love of the gospel,
to receive the Lord Jesus in the way of his coming, whether in tendering their hearts,
with a humbling sense of his goodness, or when He reveals his righteous judgments,
and shows them the inevitable consequences of walking in sin and transgression.
Those present, who had entered into covenant with their Lord and Master,
were encouraged to persevere faithfully to the end; that they may be lights in the world,
preachers of righteousness to others,
and thereby be made instrumental in drawing souls to Christ.
That in the end, the language may be addressed to them,
"`Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful in a few things,
I will make you ruler over more.
Enter you into the joy of your Lord.`"

After dining, we took an affectionate farewell of our dear aged friend H. Gibbons,
and rode to West-town.
In their afternoon meeting,
I was brought into much sympathy with the superintendents and caretakers,
on account of the arduousness of their charge;
and was led to address them with the language,
"`Let us not be weary in well doing, for in due season,
we shall reap if we faint not;`"
and to show that humiliating dispensations are necessary to reduce man,
so that he may not say, by mine own wisdom and strength have I done this;
but find that all saving, preserving help comes from the Lord,
that He may be sought unto and have the praise.
I believe some were comforted by the little that was said;
they seemed unwilling to let us depart;
but I felt best satisfied to go to a Friend`'s house near Middletown, and stay that night.

7th. Had a meeting at Middletown, which was rather a laborious time.
Dined with George Smedley, and in the afternoon,
rode to the residence of my brother-in-law J. Rhoads,
where I stayed until next afternoon,
and then went to our friend`'s, Enos Sharpless, near Chester.
My mind was plunged into a low, emptied condition,
so that I was tempted to fear I should not finish the journey to the honor of Truth,
and the benefit of those I visited.
Our friends were very kind and sympathizing, though they knew not my feelings or fears.

9th. Was their regular meeting here; and in the midst of my poverty,
the Lord condescended to furnish a word, and to give faith to arise and deliver it;
and there seemed to be some quickening power attending,
which went over the hearts of the people.
Returned to E. Sharpless`' and dined; from which we were taken to Chester village; where,
in order to escape the muddy roads, we took the cars for Wilmington,
leaving our horses and carriage behind.

10th. Attended Wilmington Monthly Meeting,
and labored among them in the love of the gospel,
to strengthen the hands of the faithful,
and to persuade the worldly-minded and the negligent to turn to the Lord,
with full purpose of heart, and serve Him,
that they may become partakers of the peace which He gives,
which passes all understanding of the natural man; and being joined to the Lamb`'s army,
may support his blessed cause in the earth.
Satisfaction was expressed with our company, and the labor.
In the afternoon, took the cars for Chester;
where we were met by our friend Jesse J. Maris, and went to his house.

11th. The weather was stormy, with snow, hail and rain;
not very pleasant to turn out into; but we rode about six miles to Chichester,
to be at an appointed meeting; which, though small, was larger than we had expected.
In condescension to his poor creature, man, the Lord tendered us together,
to the help and comfort of a little flock; for whose help,
supplication was made to the Father of mercies.

After dinner, falling into silence,
I had a little to communicate to the younger members of the family;
in which they were reminded of the all important work of their salvation.
We had about eleven miles to ride, this afternoon, to reach my brother-in-law J. Rhoads`',
and it was very pleasant to be again in company with his beloved family.

Next day I spent mostly at my brother Joseph Evans`'; and was humbled,
under a sense of much un worthiness,
and great inability to do anything in the good cause,
unless the Lord continued to take the work into his own hand, and wrought for us.

13th. Went to Springfield Meeting in much weakness,
and was rather surprised at the number of people who came.
Although I was let down under a deep feeling of my unfitness for any good word or work,
yet after a time of waiting before the Lord, a measure of holy help was extended,
and I believe the gospel was preached in the authority of Christ.
I was also bowed in deep prostration of soul, and enabled, vocally,
to return thanks to our gracious and merciful Helper, that He had not cast us off;
and to ask for the continuance of his preserving power; and that He would,
in tender compassion, gather the dear children, to submit to and follow their Savior.
The heart-tendering power of Truth went over the meeting, and contrited many;
for which thanksgiving and praise were rendered to Him who alone is worthy.

After dining at my brother Joel`'s, rode to my home,
and I was glad to be again united to my dear wife and children, under our peaceful roof;
and for the preservation of my health and safe return,
I was thankful to my Heavenly Father.

18th. We had a comfortable Meeting for Sufferings;
a pretty large committee was appointed to prepare, if way opened,
an epistle of counsel and advice to the members of our own Yearly Meeting.
20th. Darby Meeting not having been visited, I was taken there this morning.
We found it a small company.
It seemed to be my place, to labor to strengthen the things that remain,
that are ready to die; and to pray for their help, and the welfare of their young people,
that testimony-bearers to the Truth may yet be raised up among them.

23rd. Gave back my minute to the Monthly Meeting, with the acknowledgment,
that though the service was a trial of faith,
Divine mercy accompanied us from place to place,
and enabled me to discharge the duty required, to the satisfaction of my own mind.

30th. I was brought low in the prospect of our approaching Yearly Meeting;
yet at times there is granted a grain of faith,
producing the hope and confidence that the Lord will not forsake us.
But it is not in the power of man to keep us.
Unless He interferes and says to the sea,
"`Peace, be still,`"
we cannot experience a calm; and I believe He will do it,
if we are united in prayer to Him, to regard us in mercy,
and sustain us in the hollow of his hand.

Fourth month 15th. This day we had a satisfactory Meeting for Sufferings;
there being much unity with several documents which had been prepared;
particularly with an epistle of caution and counsel,
addressed to the members of our own Yearly Meeting;
which had been prepared by a committee appointed therefor.
I believe the advice contained in it, is not only pertinent and needful,
on account of the degeneracy which has been spread among us, but at the same time,
will tend to draw the members to their own condition.
We have need to be called home to work in our own vineyards.

18th. The Yearly Meeting convened today,
and epistles were received from all the Yearly Meetings we correspond with.
The proceedings of the Meeting for Sufferings were well approved;
and when the state of the subordinate branches of the Yearly Meeting was considered,
there was a solid covering over the meeting, which was encouraging.
The epistle of caution and counsel to our members,
prepared by the Meeting for Sufferings, was adopted,
and directed to be signed by the clerk, on behalf of the Yearly Meeting;
much unity being expressed with it.
The business of the meeting was conducted with much harmony,
through the different sittings.
Several Friends manifested greater interest, and spoke to the business with more freedom,
than for several years; which had a good effect in promoting feelings of unity.
The committee on the epistles to other meetings
harmonized well in the essays which they prepared,
and the same was apparent in the meeting, at their reading.
As we drew to a close, a solemn covering spread over us;
and on reading the parting minute, a profound silence prevailed,
under which the meeting concluded;
Friends being thankful for the goodness of the blessed Head of the church,
in binding us together in so much harmony, and affording us the strength and comfort,
mercifully granted; which I believe drew us nearer to one another,
in the hope that the Lord would increase the unity, and again make us feel as one people.

Fifth month 9th. I went by stage to Haddonfield Monthly Meeting,
and was exercised in the ministry in the first sitting.

Since returning from Delaware and Chester Counties, in the Third month,
I have been almost entirely shut up in silence.
Friends expressed their gladness of the visit today; yet I felt low,
though free of any sense of condemnation.
The country, after frequent showers, has a beautiful verdure,
and appears likely to be covered with rich crops of grain and grass,
for the subsistence of rebellious man.
What multitudes of blessings we have to be thankful for.
So great iniquity abounding in the land,
these bounties are an evidence of the compassion and long forbearance of a merciful God,
who continues to cause the rain to descend, and the sun to shine,
on the just and on the unjust,
and the earth regularly to yield such abundant food for man and beast.

31st. In a visit which my wife and I made at this time, to Burlington Quarterly Meeting,
we dined with a Friend who resides in an old house on the main street,
which had been occupied by his father-in-law, a minister;
where Richard Jordan and others resorted to at times,
and enjoyed a mutual interchange of thought and experience in the things of God,
with much comfort and interest to one another.
We were also told that our beloved uncle T. Scattergood, went to school in his boyhood,
in the room they occupy as a parlor.
The association of ideas with these circumstances, though of little serious importance,
called up pleasant recollections of these worthies, who were men of God,
and loved and served Him in the gospel of his dear Son, and in gathering souls to Christ.

Sixth month 10th. Was at the Arch Street Meeting;
in which the language of the Savior was revived,
that "`Men ought always to pray and not to faint.`"
God would hear his own elect, that cry day and night unto Him, and that speedily.
The elect are not to take revenge upon those who oppress them; but the day will come,
in which all will be brought to judgment;
and those who have been bringing suffering upon the living members of the church,
and in whom the precious seed is borne down, as a cart with sheaves,
will have to bear their own burdens of Divine judgment and condemnation.
It felt to me to be very important for such to be willing to have their hearts searched,
and to forsake those things which the Divine controversy is with, before it be too late.
The exercised ones were encouraged to hold on their way,
being willing to be humbled again and again, to the state of a child,
that they may be preserved from sliding from the sure foundation.
It was a season of renewed favor; in which the gospel was preached in its own authority,
and the seed visited.
The pride and loftiness of man in his earthly possessions and strength,
were declared against, and the liability of some to think too lightly of death,
as if it were an easy thing,
without sufficiently regarding its awfulness, was alluded to;
"`If the righteous scarcely are saved, where shall the ungodly and sinner appear?`"

14th. Not having been at the Northern District meeting for some time,
and feeling my mind drawn to go there this morning.
I went and sat a long time in a low state; but before closing the meeting.
I gave up in a humbled condition, to exhort them to watchfulness and prayer,
and to warn some who were soaring above the witness for God, to come down,
that they may know the work of humiliation and bowedness of soul for themselves;
for no man or woman can do the work for them.
The humble,
sincere travailers were encouraged to keep the faith and the patience of the saints;
which, I believe, contrited the hearts of some, who had been wading as in deep waters.

15th. In our own meeting, I was not easy when near time to close,
without mentioning the parable,
in which our Lord compared the kingdom of heaven to "`A net
that was cast into the sea and gathered of every kind;
which when it was full, they drew to shore,
and sat down and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.`"
And it is said, "`So shall it be at the end of the world;
the angels shall come forth and sever the wicked from the just.`"
It appeared to me that many had the offers of
salvation by the grace of God in their hearts,
and had in days past given up to it in degree, but through negligence and disobedience,
were in danger of suffering the time to pass away unimproved;
and awful will be their condition, if the end of all things here,
comes to them in this state.

16th. This morning my brother took me to Evesham,
to attend Haddonfield Quarterly Meeting, which was large.
The removal of such an experienced father and pillar from among them,
as our late beloved friend Hinchman Haines, left a peculiarly stripped sensation,
in sitting down in the meeting.
I sat for a considerable time under a sense of a contrary spirit,
and though some openings presented, they gradually disappeared and seemed to die,
and I felt willing to pass the meeting in silence, if it was the Master`'s will;
which I thought it was probable would be the case.
After abiding in this state of death,
some secret stirrings and quickenings gradually arose,
and light shone upon the necessity of every one
knowing and keeping his place in the body,
and acting only as the Master appoints;
by which the beautiful order and harmony are preserved.
His servants are not to go out with haste, nor to go by flight,
but the Lord shall go before them, and the God of Israel shall be their reward.
The true Shepherd puts forth his own sheep, and goes before them;
and the sheep follow Him; and He is also their rearguard and defense.

Every member of the Society has his rights, that others are to respect, which if they do,
will make them fellow helpers.
They will be tender of one another, and because of a difference of opinion,
where religious principles are not involved,
will not cultivate the spirit that would call
down fire upon the head of a brother or a sister,
but will keep in the suffering Spirit of the Redeemer;
who when He was nailed to the cross, said of his crucifiers,
"`Father, forgive them, they know not what they do.`"
It is in this heavenly spirit, that we learn, and are enabled to endure hardness,
as good soldiers of Jesus Christ.
But those who give way to a resentful spirit, towards others,
who do not see eye to eye with them on some things non-essential,
not having a tender feeling for the rights and the sufferings of their brethren,
will be far from enjoying true peace and happiness; but are like the troubled sea,
casting up mire and dirt.
The young people were encouraged to devote themselves to the Lord and his cause;
and the afflicted and sorrowful to look to,
and rely upon Him who can give beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning,
and the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness.
Many Friends showed their unity with the visit.

Seventh month 2nd. Early this morning my mother-in-law, Rebecca Barton,
closed a long life, we may safely believe, in peace, in the ninety-first year of her age.
She was an exemplary Friend, and anxious mother,
manifested in her godly care over her children when young,
that they might be preserved from evil;
also in the guard which she kept over her own speech;
particularly in avoiding everything prejudicial to the reputation of others.
She loved and cherished peace towards all men.

4th. Today we have had much noise in the city;
and the many cases of intemperance in young men have been mournful.
The people seem hardly to think that the Almighty takes any cognizance of evil deeds,
committed under the pretext of celebrating the
Declaration of the Independence of this country,
of Great Britain.
I believe it best and most consistent with our religious profession,
to keep aloof from all exhibitions of such character; designed to celebrate events,
attended with the effusion of human blood.
Public parades on various accounts, are increasing in our city;
by which life is sometimes put at stake, and destroyed,
and evil habits of idleness and drunkenness,
and looseness of principles and manners are thereby contracted by the working classes,
who are most drawn away with such exhibitions.

Friends may be esteemed narrow-minded, in standing opposed to such vanity and wickedness;
but there have always been witnesses for the truth,
who have withstood the popular current,
and been as the salt to preserve society from becoming entirely corrupt.
"`Great peace have all they that love your law,`"
and keep steadily in the observance of it.
When the bustle and confusion are past,
they have nothing to look back upon with condemnation.
Peace of mind and health of body have not been impaired,
by a departure from their conscientious convictions,
and their example has tended to discourage vice, not to lead others into it.

I have seldom known more desertion of the sense of Divine good,
than in the last two weeks.
I have tried to draw near to the Father of mercies, to feel after Him,
that I might be enabled to pour forth living aspirations for mercy,
and grace to help in this time of need;
but often it seemed almost impossible to keep out the suggestions of the evil one,
and utterly beyond my power to attain to any evidence of the extension of Divine regard;
though I believe there has been secret help
bestowed to keep watch against all evil thoughts,
words and deeds.
Sometimes it feels desirable to be released from the conflicts of time;
but then the importance of knowing the day`'s work accomplished,
and the soul thoroughly washed, and prepared for that glorious kingdom,
presents with great weight.

I believe there is no other way to get along rightly,
but to bear patiently the dispensations of unerring Wisdom,
and to trust and hope in his unchangeable goodness and
compassion towards the souls he has made to glorify Him.

10th. Our meeting is much reduced by Friends going to
the country for health and needful relaxation.
Silence reigned in the morning sitting;
in the afternoon I felt constrained to revive the testimony of the apostle,
"`That the trial of your faith being much more precious than gold that perishes,
though it be tried in the fire,
might be found unto praise and power and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ.`"
True and living faith and the necessary dispensations for its trial,
are of more value to the real christian, than all the gold he can possess.
Were not our faith reduced at times to a low state,
and the mind led through conflicts and fears of a very proving nature,
we should not so fully know the efficacy and the value of saving faith.
I was led to speak of the reduction and sense of destitution
which the Lord`'s children are at times brought into,
so as to fear, that one day they may fall by the hand of their enemy.
But He knows our frame and our weakness; and if in these humbling baptisms,
we lift up our eye to Him, imploring his protecting power, He will not desert us;
but the everlasting arm, though invisible to us, will be underneath to support,
and to defend us from our cruel enemy.
And when He sees we have been sufficiently prostrated, He will lift us up again,
and the Sun of Righteousness will arise upon us,
with healing and renovating power and virtue, strengthen us to gird up our loins,
put our trust anew in Him, and run the race of his appointing and leading.
Some souls were comforted, and tears of thankfulness flowed to the Lord most High;
and a dear Friend returned thanks,
and offered prayer for the continued mercy and
preserving power of the blessed Shepherd of the sheep.

12th. My wife and myself went out to our brother`'s, at Springfield,
to spend two or three weeks with them.
It is a quiet, peaceful retreat, where the physical and mental powers may be invigorated.

17th. Was at their first-day meeting;
in which it appeared to be my place to endeavor to stir up the people
to engage more fervently in the great work of their own salvation,
while time and the day of mercy are lengthened to them.
We have to hope against hope, there appears so little fruit from all the labor bestowed;
and yet how much wider many would stray from the fold, we know not,
were no warning voice raised, or any evidence given,
that we are deeply interested in their everlasting welfare.

On second-day morning, the 25th, came into the city to our select Preparative Meeting;
also attended our Monthly Meeting on the 27th, which was satisfactory.

31st. I was engaged in our first-day morning meeting,
in declaring our faith in the Divine authority and the value of the Holy Scriptures;
also in the universality of the gift of Divine grace, through our Lord Jesus Christ;
by which the work of regeneration and sanctification is effected in the heart of man,
and he is brought up into the image of God, in which Adam was created,
and from which he fell by transgression.
Holy help was mercifully extended, opening these Divine, essential truths with clearness,
and clothing with authority to communicate them; so that, I trust,
they reached the witness in some hearts present.

Eighth month 1st. Our Quarterly Meeting was a solid time;
in which my dear wife was drawn forth in sympathy with the suffering seed,
and led to encourage these to keep the faith and patience of the saints;
believing the Lord would hear and arise for the groans of his children,
and deliver them in his way and time.
E+++.+++ Pitfield concluded in prayer for the tribulated ones,
and that we may keep the everlasting patience.
There was but little business; the meeting was preserved under a proper weight.

4th. Went to Middletown Meeting, where we found a company of Friends,
who seemed to me to be holding back too much from religious service.
Some partly from being taken up with their worldly business,
and partly from diffidence of their ability for service.
It appeared to be my duty to warn them of the engrossing things of this life,
which are proper in their right place;
and also of dwelling too much upon discouraging apprehensions of
their own weakness and inability for any good work in the church;
but to remember that the enemy is at hand to urge such thoughts,
for the purpose of deterring us from seeking the Lord for strength,
and from laying hold of it, when offered, with the pointings of duty.
Even a few faithful, devoted ones,
may be instrumental in stirring up others to yield to the Lord`'s requirings,
and to show themselves openly on his side.
It was a low time in Israel,
when Jonathan and his armor-bearer showed themselves to the Philistines,
who unwittingly confirmed the sign of victory; and by faith in the Lord`'s power,
they attacked their enemies, and led the way for their being put to rout;
the Lord in a marvelous manner striking terror through the host,
and setting their swords against one another.
I thought Divine goodness, and the quickening virtue of the Holy Spirit,
was a little felt among us.

11th. I felt drawn in love to Friends of Salem Quarterly Meeting,
and went to Woodbury through some discouragements;
where I was kindly received by many Friends.
The removal by death of several substantial and elderly members out of this meeting,
is keenly felt by the rightly-concerned among them.
But it seems to me, though we may not always be able to see it,
that the Lord is leading some of the young ones in secret,
to look at the condition of Zion, and to long for her strength and enlargement.
Whatever may be the discouragements which this class,
and those of deeper experience may endure, if they look to Him,
He will sustain through all, bring them up out of low places, and cause them,
if faithful to his pointings, to go on their way rejoicing.
"`The Lord`'s portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance;
He found him in a desert land, and in the waste, howling wilderness; He led him about,
He instructed him, He kept him as the apple of his eye.`"
It is often He thus instructs his children, and prepares them for service in his church;
and as they are entirely devoted to Him,
He gives them gifts to be occupied for the edification of others,
and their own salvation.

In his renewed mercy, He raised me up to declare of his goodness and compassion,
and my belief that a succession of testimony and standard-bearers,
would be again and again raised up among us,
to maintain the principles and testimonies which He called our forefathers to promulgate.
It was a season of renewed favor and comfort to us,
and I hope some were cheered and strengthened,
and the praise ascribed to Him to whom alone it belongs.
In the afternoon returned home peaceful.

14th. First-day.
The weather is extremely warm, and has been so most of the time since the Sixth month.
Many have been overcome with the heat, according to the accounts published in the papers,
and some have died suddenly.
Our religious meetings are greatly reduced;
but I hope many of those who continue in the city, are praying in spirit,
that the Lord will regard us in our low estate.

I was engaged to refer to the vision of the stone cut out of the mountain without hands,
which smote and broke to pieces the image, and ground it to powder,
so that it was carried away like the chaff of the summer threshing-floor.
It grew until it filled the whole earth,
showing the power and final prevalence of the kingdom of Christ,
and the weakness of every obstacle placed in his way.
This is also to be experienced in ourselves; that every idol man is worshipping,
instead of the living God, may be destroyed; every high thing laid low,
and the Lord alone exalted in the heart.
Herein we shall be brought to the enjoyment of true peace and happiness,
and a solid ground to hope for a place among the saints in light, when the end comes.

15th. Went to Germantown, and attended the funeral of our late friend Ann Mifflin,
who died in her seventy-fifth year; having been a member, I am told,
of our Monthly Meeting, from her birth.
She was attached to our principles and testimonies,
and was placed in the station of elder several years ago.
One after another of the older members are removing, who occupied stations in the church,
and it ought to be the prayer of survivors,
that the Lord in mercy would lay his hand upon sons and daughters,
and bring them under a living concern for themselves, and for his blessed cause;
that a succession of standardbearers may be continued,
to attract others to the blessed cause of the Redeemer.

Ninth month 2nd. Tomorrow commences Ohio Yearly Meeting;
which brings with it the feeling of deep interest and
sympathy with our dear friends there,
who bear the burden and heat of the day.
It is desirable they may be enabled to look to their own condition,
and labor to repair and build up the breaches,
and to derive a little comfort from the fresh extendings of heavenly good;
showing that the Lord has not deserted them nor the cause they espouse.

8th. In conversation on the peculiar state of our Society,
and in reference to the wishes of some for separation,
I took the opportunity to say that I did not
unite with Friends running out of a back door,
to get away from trouble.
Our place is to stand firm and face it openly, contending for the truth,
and opposing wrong things as they appear.
Separation deprives those who leave,
of the opportunity of opposing error in the members from whom they have separated;
and none know how soon something may again arise among themselves, to create contention,
and lead to another separation.
If we keep our places, and bear a faithful testimony for the truth,
and against all departures from it, though at the time we do not see the effect,
yet we may believe that the Lord will carry that testimony home to the hearts of some,
so that it will arise from time to time with convincing power, and finally prevail.
Jerusalem is a burdensome stone, to those who would pervert and turn judgment backward,
and the Lord can save by few or by many.

Where unsanctified persons obtain the rule,
and seek to carry out measures opposed to the principles or testimonies of the gospel,
the rightly concerned and faithful members, should labor in the ability the Lord gives,
to prevent their adoption.
Should their efforts be disregarded, they will be clear,
if they have done what they could; the Lord will plead his own cause,
and we hope will in his time, make way for the truth to rise into dominion.
Seducers and evil-workers will wax worse and worse;
they will be removed by death as well as others; and through patient suffering,
a right seed keeping their places, will be prepared to take the government,
under the Blessed Head, and to restore the good old way,
in which our primitive Friends walked, and to put down what is inconsistent therewith.

11th. Our first-day meeting was evidently larger than it had been for weeks;
the weather being cool and fine.
From some cause the meetings are at times laborious seasons,
it is so difficult to attain that seclusion from worldly things,
indispensable to the performance of spiritual worship.
I felt for some strangers who came in, and towards the latter part of the meeting,
was moved to hold forth the doctrine,
that man is not left to his own exertions to find out the will of God concerning him,
but it is immediately made known to him by the Holy Spirit,
which enlightens the dark heart; and as those manifestations are obeyed,
it gives the power to forsake sin, and to do those things which it requires;
in doing which, the work of regeneration is carried on,
and a total change of heart is effected.
I believe the testimony reached some present with conviction,
though they do not obey the Truth as they should do.

18th. A day of remarkable absence of all sense of Divine good,
attended with difficulty in withdrawing the mind from worldly cogitations,
and centering it upon spiritual things.
It was a decided proof of the weakness and nothingness of man,
unable without the help of the Holy Spirit, to think a good thought,
or to command the least evidence of heavenly notice or regard.
Surely there must be a design in being thus stripped.
May it more and more humble me into the dust, preserve from relying on past experience,
and prepare for the manifestation of fresh mercy,
and the ability to declare of the Lord`'s power and goodness,
and faithfulness to his poor creature, man,
in the renewed extension of it to my soul in the hour of need, and when He sees meet.

19th. This morning I awoke with desires to lay aside all unnecessary anxiety,
and to put my trust in the Lord; assured that He would preserve those who looked to Him,
and would sustain his own cause.
The language passed through my mind, "`They that trust in the Lord,
shall not be confounded; they shall be as Mount Zion, that cannot be removed.`"
The holy presence seemed to be near.
